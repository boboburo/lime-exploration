# What is ML Interpretability ?

- for a data scientist.. 

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:200px; LEFT:85px; WIDTH:350px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/compare-ROC.png")>

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:170px; LEFT:500px; WIDTH:350px; HEIGHT:400px" SRC="images/rf-feat-importance.png")>

???

- For a data scientist can often look something like this. 

- Models are evaluating using various accuracy metrics and typical on validataion dataset. 

- data scientist will select a model from a number of alternatives.

- From data product point of view - the evaluation metric of a model may not align with the final data Product goal. 

- story here ??? 

- then question is there truly alignment between the metrics that we can compute and optimize (e.g. accuracy) and the actual metrics of interest such as user engagement and retention.

### Interpretablity vs .Complexity

(Points from Intelligible Models for HealthCare: Predicting Pneumonia Risk and Hospital 30-day Readmission, Microsoft)

- In ML there is often tradeoff must be made between accuracy and intelligibility. 

- CNN can have millions of parameters. 

- More accurate models such as boosted trees, random forests, and neural nets usually are not intelligible 

- More intelligible models such as logistic regression, naive-Bayes, and single decision trees often have significantly worse accuracy. 

- Even a logistic regressions with many coefficents is difficult to interpret.

- This tradeoff sometimes limits the accuracy of models that can be applied in mission-critical applications being able to under-stand, validate, edit an model output is important. 

- right graph minst dataset

### ML Interpretability Goal

- create technique to produce more explainable models, while maintaining high level of performance

- present textual or visual artifacts

- all the data product consumer to augment their prior domain knowledge

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:300px; LEFT:100px; WIDTH:750px; HEIGHT:350px" SRC="images/darpa-trust.png")>


???

- slide for XAI program DARPA

-  present textual or visual artifacts that provide qualitative understanding of the relationship between the instance’s components (e.g. words in text, patches in an image) and the model’s prediction

- Humans usually have prior knowledge about the application domain, which they can use to accept (trust) or reject a prediction if they understand the reasoning behind it.

# Why ML Interpretability

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:150px; LEFT:100px; WIDTH:750px; HEIGHT:350px" SRC="images/flu-explain.png")>


???

- in many machine learning data products, a user is being asked to interact with the outputs of a model to help them make a decision. 

- there are high stake situations, a doctor will not take an action, just because "the model said so"

- with good reason. 

- In the mid 90’s, a large multi-institutional project was created to evaluate the application of machine learning to important problems in healthcare such as predicting pneumonia risk. 

- the goal was to predict the probability of death (POD) for patients with pneumonia so that high-risk patients could be admitted to the hospital while low-risk patients were treated as outpatients. 

- the most accurate models that could be trained were neural nets, outperforming other methods by a wide margin (the neural net had AUC=0.86 compared to 0.77 for logistic regression),

- Although the neural nets were the most accurate models, after careful consideration they were considered too risky for use on real patients and logistic resgression was used instead. 

- Why?

- the models had learnt the a rule that patients with a history of asthma have lower risk of dying, therefore treat them as an outpatient. 

- this  rule found in logistic regression was counterintuitive. But it reflected a true pattern in the training data: patients with a history of asthma who pre- sented with pneumonia usually were admitted not only to the hospital but directly to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) -  and thus had lower probality of dying than the general population.

# Legal Requirements


???

- there are legal requirements in place in the USA under the fair credit reporting act. When a creditor takes adverse action and uses a numerical score in a decision the four or five factors that determines those decision most be given to the person it adversely affects. 

- reason codes

- the bank Capital One are on record saying the company would like to use deep learning for all sorts of functions, including deciding who is granted a credit card. 

- But it cannot do that because the legal requirements companies to explain the reason for any such decision to a prospective customer. 

- Late last year Capital One created a research team dedicated to finding ways of making these computer techniques more explainable.

- in Europe the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that automated decision making including including profiling must be explainable to the person that is being acted upon. 

- potentially prohibits a wide swath of algorithms currently in use in, e.g., recommendation systems, credit and insurance risk assessments, 
advertising, and social networks. 

- In its current form, the GDPR’s requirements could require a complete overhaul of standard and widely used algorithmic techniques.

# Interpretablity for a DS

- bias or leakage

- data shift/drift

- feedback loops to improve model 

<IMG STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:150px; LEFT:100px; WIDTH:750px; HEIGHT:250px" SRC="images/lime-leakage.png")>



???

- but bringing it back into the room, we don't care about all that!!! 

- what about the benefits of for a DS. 

- could interpretability help identify potential points of leakage when training a model. In the LIME paper, the present 

- data leakage - in the LIME paper the present the above example for 



points from the paper
- data bias - horse story
- feedback loops



In a sense, every time an engineer uploads a machine learning model to production, the engineer is implicitly trusting that the model will make sensible predictions. Such assessment is usually done by looking at held-out accuracy or some other aggregate measure. However, as anyone who has ever used machine learning in a real application can attest, such metrics can be very misleading. Sometimes data that shouldn't be available accidentally leaks into the training and into the held-out data (e.g., looking into the future). Sometimes the model makes mistakes that are too embarrassing to be acceptable. These and many other tricky problems indicate that understanding the model's predictions can be an additional useful tool when deciding if a model is trustworthy or not, because humans often have good intuition and business intelligence that is hard to capture in evaluation metrics. Assuming a “pick step” in which certain representative predictions are selected to be explained to the human would make the process similar to the one illustrated in Figure 2.

# R Plots

- Lime is available for [Python](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime) and more recently Thomas Lin Pedersen has implemented in [R](https://github.com/thomasp85/lime).

```{r install, eval=F}
pip install lime
devtools::install_github("thomasp85/lime")
```

#### Python Implementation

```{python lime.pyton, eval = F,  collapse = T}
import lime
import lime.lime_tabular

explainer = lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(train,
   feature_names= names(train.X), 
   class_names= train.y, discretize_continuous=True)
   
i = np.random.randint(0, test.X[0])
exp = explainer.explain_instance(test.X[i], model.predict_proba, 
      num_features=2, top_labels=1)

#In a Jupyter Notebook
exp.show_in_notebook(show_table=True, show_all=False)
```

---

#### R Implementation

```{r lime.r, eval = F,  collapse = T}
library(lime)

explainer <- lime(train.data, tuned.model , 
                  bin_continuous = TRUE, 
                  n_bins = 4, n_permutations = 1000)

#Grab 1 or more examples to explain
test.example <- sample_n(test.data, 1)

explained.example <- explainer(test.example, 
                               n_labels = 2, n_features = 5, feature_select = "auto")
plot_features(expalined.exampled, ncol = 2)

### Feature Engineering



Stastical Modelling

At the same time when doing modelling, we seek to minimise the expected error. This can be decomposed in two terms, the Bias and the Variance. Bias represents the distance between the actual model producing the data and the one we use while variance captures the complexity of the model. When our goal is to do statistical modelling to test a causal hypothesis, i.e. explain, we focus on minimising the distance between the actual model and the one we constructed, thus minimise bias. On the other hand when predicting we care mostly about minimising the combined bias and variance, and sometimes this means sacrificing model accuracy, thus increasing bias, for minimising variance, an example of which is regularisation.
